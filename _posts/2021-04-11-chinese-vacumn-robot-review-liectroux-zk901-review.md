First, Vacuum Robot are awesome, they make your floor dust free.

I used to sweep, then mop my apartment once a week, at weekend. In weekdays, I often has to wash my feet because my floor get dusty quickly, and my apartment is in a less populated place comparing to other ones in Ho Chi Minh City.

One day I got feed up with washing my feet too often, and got my-self a 200$ vacuum robot from Chinese, named Liectroux ZK901, and my floor has been cleaner than ever. No more wet feet in before go to bed (hooray).

The robot I bought is not very good. It navigation system is stupid. It hits the wall, the chair, the table legs, basically everything all the time. It is advertised with LIDAR navigation system and stuff, but I guess it is mostly BS.

Lessons learned: don't believe in advertisement. Also don't risk my money with less-known brands.

But, even though the robot is bad, it is still better than sweep and moping by hand, and I am happy that I bought one.

The next time I buy, this is the things that I will check carefully before making purchase decision.

### How good is the navigation system

Modern Vacuum Robot use LIDAR navigation system, that is just works (not like mine). Some series also has cameras to recognize stuff like children toys, dogs litter, wires.

Also bad ones will fall off stairs or any places that is uneven.

### How good is the app's mapping function

When robot run, they will scan your home and draw a map on their application.

You can then use function likes zoning, virtual wall to control where they should/shouldn't clean.

Liectroux ZK901 only support 1 map, so it is not suitable for multi floor houses. It also only allow user to create 10 zone (including virtual walls), and it is not enough for my 76m2 flat.

### How long its battery will last before degrade

Most phones I knows have their battery go bad after 1 or 2 years. Vacuum robot is the same. I suspect that bad vacuum robot will have their battery degrade even sooner.

I thrown my old hand vacuum also because the battery is dead after 1.5 years. The cost of replacement is nearly enough to buy a new one. It is no problem to buy a new one but I feel it is not environmental friendly.
