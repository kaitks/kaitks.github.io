A programmer is a device for turning caffeine into code. <cite>Erdős</cite>

## Programming, even though seem easy-cheesy from the outside, is actually one of the most demanding careers

Because programmer will sit in one place, typing 10 hours a day while constantly focus on a big screen, for decades.

It is not healthy.

Many programmers suffered from burn-out, hand and back injuries, as well as eyes issues.

Many had to quit.

But programmer can improve their life and prolonging their career by getting the right equipments.

### A good keyboard

Most companies in tech industry do not provide employees with a good keyboard. Normally the programmer will get a HP or Dell keyboard. Typing on those keyboard for a long time will hurt your fingers. I've been there and suffered.

Instead being suffer like me, you can invest in yourself a good keyboard. Mechanical keyboards from famous brands like Filco, Leopold are rock solid. They are of high-quality, non-distracting and have reasonable prices. Wireless one is more portable. Get the brown switch, it is in the sweet spot of functionality and quiet. Blue switch will annoy the crap out of your colleagues.

### A ergonomic mouse

I know, if you are pro, you rarely have to touch the mouse. But become pro take times, and if you work with graphic, you have to use it.

Lots of programmers that I know play game too.

Bad mouse holding position will lead to wrist injuries. An ergonomic mouse will make your wrist happier.

There are tons of ergonomic mouse out there. I haven't try all of them. But this is what works for me:
- If you right-handed, get a right-tilted, like [mouse](https://mionix.net/naos-7000).
- If you are left-handed, get a left-tilted mouse.

I haven't try other type of mouses as they don't seem suitable for gaming.

### A lambda chair

[Lambda chair](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chair) are the ones with a curved body that supports your lower back and are in perfect match with the curve of your spine.

Back injuries are pretty common among office workers, especially programmers. The injuries are really bad and greatly affect your quality of life. Do not hesitate to invest in this.

My legs used to be numb when I sit for an extended time. My recent company provide me with a very [good chair](https://www.humanscale.com/products/seating/world-one) and I no longer got it.

### A second monitor

Nowadays most companies I see provide programmers with two monitors. If your company do not do so, ask them to get you a second one or just buy it yourself.

With two monitors you get double the space to arrange your working windows. E.g. your text editor on the left and the browser on the right, so you can edit your CSS and see the change in real time (with hot-code loading). You can also coding your API while looking at the spec on the second monitor.

You will switch window less often, be able to stay in focus longer, and your productivity will be up at least 20% in most cases.

23" to 27″ ones are most commons. And pay attention to monitor glare. Adjust your monitor accordingly to avoid it.

### A Macbook Pro

This is highly opinionated. I used both Ubuntu laptops and Macbook. Ubuntu laptops are good but Macbook is great.
- Its track-pad and monitor are exceptional.
- Its battery will last you a whole day.
- Its design screams high-quality and minimal.
- Even its adapter look nice.
- The OS is intuitive.
- If you also do design, it is the natural choice as it is compatible with Adobe CS, Sketch...

### A noise isolated headphone

Very often, programmers are crammed in to a big room, right next to their busy managers. There is not much personal space and noise from people speaking, laughing, shouting at each others are distracting. And instead of producing quality code, you sit there and think about all the mistakes you made in life.

But not if you have a headphone.

Headphone gives you Zen.

Buy a headphone.
