A programmer is a device for turning caffeine into code. <cite>Erdős</cite>

## Programming, even though seem easy-cheesy from the outside, is actually one of the most demanding careers

Because you will sit in one place, typing on your laptop 12 hours a day and constantly focus on soulless text on a monitor, for decades.

It is not healthy.

Many programmers suffered from burn-out, hand and back injuries, as well as eyes issues.

Many had to quit.

But you can make your life easier and prolonging your programming career by getting the right equipments.

### A good keyboard

Most companies in tech industry do not provide employees with a good keyboard. Normally you will get a HP or Dell keyboard. They are decent at best, and typing on them for a long time will hurt your fingers really bad. I've been there, and you will too.

Invest a good keyboard. Mechanical keyboards from Filco, Leopold are rock solid. They are of high-quality, non-distracting and have reasonable prices. Filco is wireless, thus more portable. Get the brown switch, it is in the sweet spot of functionality and quiet. Blue switch will annoy the crap out of your colleagues.

### A ergonomic mouse

I know, if you are pro, you rarely have to touch the mouse. But become pro take times, and if you work with graphic, you have to use it.

Lots of programmers that I know play game too.

Bad mouse holding position will lead to wrist injuries. An ergonomic mouse will make your wrist happier.

There are tons of ergonomic mouse out there. I haven't try all of them. But this is what works for me:
- If you right-handed, get a right-tilted [mouse](https://mionix.net/naos-7000).
- If you are left-handed, get a left-tilted mouse.

And that's usually enough.

### A lambda chair

[Lambda chair](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chair) are the ones with a curved body that supports your lower back and are in perfect match with the curve of your spine.

Back injuries are pretty common among office workers, especially programmers. The injuries are really bad and greatly affect your quality of life. Do not hesitate to invest in this.

### A second monitor

Nowadays most companies I see provide programmers with two monitors. If your company do not do so, ask them to get you a second one or just buy it yourself.

With two monitors you get double the space to arrange your working windows. E.g. your text editor on the left and the browser on the right, so you can edit your CSS and see the change in real time (with hot-code loading). You can also coding your API while looking at the spec on the second monitor.

You will switch window less often, be able to stay in focus longer, and your productivity will be up at least 20% in most cases.

23/24″ is good enough. 27″ is often too big in a normal office place. And pay attention to light reflection. It makes day and night different in the long run.

### A Macbook

This is highly opinionated. I used both Ubuntu laptops and Macbook. Ubuntu laptops are fine but Macbook is purely great.
- Its track-pad, keyboard and monitor are exceptional.
- Its battery will easily last you a day.
- Its design screams high-quality, is minimal and well balanced in details.
- Even its adapter look nice.
- The OS is very intuitive.
- Its is very easy to install packages using brew.
- If you do design, it is the natural choice as it is compatible with Adobe CS, Sketch... There is no worthy alternative.
- It makes you feel good.
- It is inspirational.
- And if you want to upgrade, its resell value is high.

Once you go Mac, you never go back.

### A noise isolated headphone

Very often, programmers are crammed in to a big room, right next to their busy managers. There is not much personal space and noise from people speaking, laughing, shouting at each others are distracting. And instead of producing quality code, you sit there and think about all the mistakes you made in life.

But not if you have a headphone.

Headphone gives you Zen.

Buy a headphone.
