And my productivity has never been higher.

## Why I chose Atom

Atom is not my first IDE. I used Sublime during the first two years. Even though I have no problem with Sublime, there are two things that I do not particular fond of:
- Its pop-ups are annoying (I know, what should I expect, I was using its free version).
- It is maintained by one developer, and is closed source.

So when Atom came out, I quickly made the jump.

Out of the box, Atom seem perfect:
- Its UI is beautiful.
- It supports many syntax.
- It maintains by Github, the big name that everyone love. It is also open-source, so it has lot of potential to be improved.

But its drawback is big: speed. Open files large than 1mb takes long time on my pc, and navigation felt slow. Its "go to declaration" is also buggy. Maybe my configure is wrong, but I were not able to make it work.

With Atom, I have to be very careful when navigating in node_modules folder, one click on big lib file may take me 20secs waiting for the window to response.

When collapsing all sub-folder with ctr + click, sometimes my pc freezes.

I felt restricted by my tool.

### So I switched back to Sublime, and I realized how fast it was

The drawbacks are still there, but it is not as important as the speed gain I get.

My next IDE might be vim based, but in the meanwhile, Sublime is good enough.
